Machiavelli
===

Are you interviewing for a new position but your secret emails are being constantly released in the public? Is this affecting your public image? Is the other candidate capable of destroying life on earth as we know it? Luckily, we have a solution for you.

Introducing Machiavelli, a revolutionary messaging system to hide in plain sight. We will encode your message in a random image on Twitter and post it back using one of thousands anonymous accounts using trending hashtags from random countries in the world. Thanks to the power of our solution, the receiver will analyze every image and detect when a message is hidden. Our solution is untraceable as it doesn't use rules that can be back engineered because it solely relies on our concurrent processing power.

With Machiavelli you can finally send safely your next Goldman Sachs speech fee or easily receive the information of your husband whereabouts.

One more thing.

Also introducing Rat, the backdoor for any Machiavelli-based solution to intercept and decode, coming soon for a nominal fee for selected central eurasian national agencies.
